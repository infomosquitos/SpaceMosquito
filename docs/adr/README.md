# Architecture Decision Records

ADRs capture **durable** choices (stack, boundaries, contracts) that should outlive any single task.

## When to write an ADR

- Choosing or changing language, frameworks, hosting, or major libraries.
- Defining system boundaries or data/API contracts that other work depends on.
- Recording a trade-off so future agents do not re-litigate it in every task.

Prefer a **task doc** (`dev/tasks/…`) for short-lived design while building a feature. On cleanup, promote lasting decisions from the task doc into an ADR (or FAQ / layer README) before deleting the task file — see [`dev/CLEANUP.md`](../../dev/CLEANUP.md).

## Conventions

- Files: `docs/adr/adr-NNN-short-title.md` (zero-padded number, kebab-case title).
- Status: `Proposed` | `Accepted` | `Superseded` | `Deprecated`.
- Link related ADRs and FAQ pages.
- Copy [`TEMPLATE.md`](TEMPLATE.md) for a new record.
